# 2025_marutani_pd_mouse
Code repository for RNA-seq and proteomics analyses from:

Marutani et al. Hypoxia ameliorates neurodegeneration and movement disorder in a mouse model of Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Nature Neuroscience. 2025.

This repository contains code to reproduce analyses and figure panels for the bulk RNA-seq and TMT proteomics data in the paper. The RNA-seq/ and TMT_proteomics/ subdirectories contain information and code about how the initial quality control and differential expression analyses were run, and the `plot_paper_figures.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code to reproduce figure panels in the paper.
